# Weather App

A simple web application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This application allows users to search for weather conditions in a city and displays relevant weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## Features

- **City Search**: Input a city name to retrieve and display the weather conditions for that location.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark mode for ease of reading regardless of ambient lighting.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices thanks to responsive CSS.
